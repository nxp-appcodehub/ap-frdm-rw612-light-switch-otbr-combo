## FRDM RW612 Matter light & switch app plus Thread Border Router solution

This example is built on Matter and the NXP RW612 SDK, supporting remote access and control of a light bulb over Wi-Fi with OpenThread Border Router (OTBR).<br />

The Matter FRDM-RW612 Light Switch Combo example demonstrates a dual-endpoint application. Endpoint 1 represents a Light Device (bulb), while Endpoint 2 functions as a Light Switch device.Buttons are used to either turn the local light bulb (Endpoint 1) on and off or control other bound lights via Endpoint 2, which acts as a switch. This example serves as a reference for developing your own Matter-based applications. <br />

It operates as a Matter accessory, meaning it can be paired with an existing Matter network and controlled through that network.<br />

# Create the project
$ gn gen --args='chip_enable_wifi=true chip_enable_openthread=true nxp_enable_matter_cli=true board_version="frdm" nxp_use_factory_data=false chip_enable_ota_requestor=false no_mcuboot=true' out/debug
$ ninja -C out/debug
```

#### General information

The application binary can be found in
out/debug/<b>chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example</b>

Optional GN options that can be added when building an application:

-   To enable the
    [matter CLI](README.md#testing-the-all-clusters-application-with-matter-cli-enabled),
    the argument `chip_enable_matter_cli=true` must be added to the _gn gen_
    command.
-   By default, the `NXP RD-RW612-BGA` board revision will be chosen. To switch to `NXP FRDM-RW612` board revision, the argument
    `board_version=\"frdm\"` must be added to the _gn gen_ command.
-   To build the application in debug mode, the argument
    `is_debug=true optimize_debug=false` must be added to the _gn gen_ command.
-   To build with the option to have Matter certificates/keys pre-loaded in a
    specific flash area the argument `nxp_use_factory_data=true` can be added to
    the _gn gen_ command. (for more information see
    [Guide for writing manufacturing data on NXP devices](https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/docs/guides/nxp/nxp_manufacturing_flow.md).
-   To build the application with the OTA Requestor enabled, the arguments
    `chip_enable_ota_requestor=true no_mcuboot=false` must be added to the _gn
    gen_ command. (More information about the OTA Requestor feature in
    [OTA Requestor README](https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/docs/guides/nxp/nxp_rw61x_ota_software_update.md)


## 4. Flashinbg and debugging<a name="step4"></a>
There 2 ways to flash the application image to FRDK-RW612, Jlink, and MCUXpresso. The first way to flash the application on FRDM-RW612 is using the Jlink tool.

### 4.1 Flashing with JLink tool
1. Install [JLink_Windows](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)
2. The original application file name is `chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example.hex`. change the file extension form “.hex ” to “.srec ”, after the file name: <b>chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example.srec</b>

3. Create a txt file - `commands_script` and with the following content (change the application name accordingly):
```
reset
halt
loadfile chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example-frdm.srec
reset
go
quit
```
4. Copy the application and commands_script in the folder where the JLink executable is placed. Execute:
```
$  jlink -device RW612 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1 -CommanderScript commands_script
```
After the flash success, start the application on the RW612 FRDM.

### 4.2 Flashing with MCUXpresso IDE

In order to flash the application we recommended  using
[MCUXpresso IDE (version >= 11.6.0)](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE).

-   Import the previously downloaded NXP SDK into MCUXpresso IDE. ([link](https://community.nxp.com/t5/MCUXpresso-IDE-Knowledge-Base/Importing-an-MCUXpresso-SDK-into-MCUXpresso-IDE/ta-p/1101175))

Right click the empty space in the MCUXpresso IDE "Installed SDKs" tab to show
the menu, select the "Import archive" (or "Import folder" if a folder is used)
menu item.

-   Import the connectedhomeip repo in MCUXpresso IDE as Makefile Project. Use
    _none_ as _Toolchain for Indexer Settings_:

```
File -> Import -> C/C++ -> Existing Code as Makefile Project
```

-   Configure MCU Settings:

```
Right click on the Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> MCU Settings -> Select RW612 -> Apply & Close
```

![MCU_Set](images/mcu-set.png)

-   Configure the toolchain editor:

```
Right click on the Project -> C/C++ Build-> Tool Chain Editor -> NXP MCU Tools -> Apply & Close
```

![toolchain](images/toolchain.jpg)

-   Create a debug configuration :

```
Right click on the Project -> Debug -> As->SEGGER JLink probes -> OK -> Select elf file
```

-   Debug using the newly created configuration file.

## 5. Matter cli mode<a name="step5"></a>
CHIP Tool is a Matter controller which can be used to commission a Matter device
into the network. For more information regarding how to use the CHIP Tool
controller, please refer to the
[CHIP Tool guide](https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/docs/guides/chip_tool_guide.md).

To know how to commission a device over BLE, follow the instructions from
[chip-tool's README.md 'Commission a device over
BLE'][readme_ble_commissioning_section].

[readme_ble_commissioning_section]:
https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/examples/chip-tool/README.md#commission-a-device-over-ble

To know how to commissioning a device over IP, follow the instructions from
[chip-tool's README.md 'Pair a device over
IP'][readme_pair_ip_commissioning_section]

[readme_pair_ip_commissioning_section]:
https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/examples/chip-tool/README.md#pair-a-device-over-ip

### Testing the chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example application with Matter CLI enabled:

The Matter CLI can be enabled with the chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example application.

For more information about the Matter CLI default commands, you can refer to the
dedicated [ReadMe](https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/examples/shell/README.md).

The chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example application supports additional commands :

```
> help
[...]
mattercommissioning     Open/close the commissioning window. Usage : mattercommissioning [on|off]
matterfactoryreset      Perform a factory reset on the device
matterreset             Reset the device
```

-   `matterfactoryreset` command erases the file system completely (all Matter
    settings are erased). Or You can hold SW2 for 3 seconds for the device factoryreset.
-   `matterreset` enables the device to reboot without erasing the settings.

Here are described steps to use the light-switch-combo-app with the Matter CLI enabled

1. Prepare the board with the flashed `chip-rw61x-light-switch-combo-example` (as shown
   above).
2. The matter CLI is accessible in `MCU-Link`. For that, start a terminal emulator
   like PuTTY and connect to the used COM port with the following UART settings:

    - Baud rate: 115200
    - 8 data bits
    - 1 stop bit
    - No parity
    - No flow control

3. On the client side, start sending commands using the chip-tool application as
   it is described
   [here](https://github.com/NXP/matter/blob/v1.4.0-pvw1/examples/chip-tool/README.md#using-the-client-to-send-matter-commands).
